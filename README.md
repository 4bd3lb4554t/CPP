## 🏫 About 42 School

[42](https://profile-v3.intra.42.fr/) is a renowned, tuition-free programming school with a peer-to-peer learning model and project-based curriculum. It encourages learning through real-world challenges, teamwork, and creativity — no teachers, no classes, just code. 😎

This repository contains my journey through the **C++ Piscine**, designed to level up C programming skills and transition into the world of **Object-Oriented Programming** with C++.

## 🧠 Module Overview

### 📦 `CPP00` – Basics of C++ Classes
- Intro to C++ syntax, classes, methods, and namespaces.
- Concepts: `iostream`, constructors, member functions.

### 📦 `CPP01` – Memory & File Streams
- Dynamic memory, references, file manipulation.
- Concepts: `new`, `delete`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`.

### 📦 `CPP02` – Operator Overloading
- Creating custom class behaviors via operators.
- Concepts: `this` pointer, copy constructor, overload `=`.

### 📦 `CPP03` – Inheritance
- Single inheritance, base vs. derived classes.
- Canonical form implementation.

### 📦 `CPP04` – Abstract Classes & Polymorphism
- Abstract classes, pure virtual methods, dynamic dispatch.
- Key topic: virtual destructors.

### 📦 `CPP05` – Exception Handling
- Throwing and catching exceptions.
- Nested exceptions, custom exception classes.

### 📦 `CPP06` – Type Casting
- Explicit casting in C++: `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, etc.
- Type identification using `typeid`.

### 📦 `CPP07` – Templates & Iterators
- Function/class templates and custom iterators.
- Focus: `template <typename T>`, iterating over containers.

### 📦 `CPP08` – STL and Algorithms
- Using Standard Template Library: `vector`, `list`, `map`.
- Algorithms like `sort`, `find`, `count`.
